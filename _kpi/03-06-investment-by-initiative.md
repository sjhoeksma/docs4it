**This metric answers the questions**:
* Do IT projects line up with business priorities?
* Are we investing enough in our strategic initiatives?

**How to use it**:
* Align IT spend with business strategy
* Identify projects that do not contribute to business objectives

**Cadence**:
* Annually

**Example:**
Business initiatives require technology investment. If Company A is focused on improving patient outcomes, building mobile capabilities, and expanding geographically, this metric helps IT leaders ensure IT is doing its part to support these initiatives by spending on the right things. Use this metric to clearly articulate alignment with business strategy and demonstrate the investment necessary to accomplish business goals.
