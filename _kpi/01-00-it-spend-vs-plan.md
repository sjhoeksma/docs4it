**This metric answers the questions**:
1. Are you spending what you expected to spend?
1. Which areas of spend are over/under plan?

**How to use it:**
* Detect and correct anomalies before they become crises
* Drive a culture of accountability within your IT organization
(for both OpEx & CapEx budgets)

**Cadence:**
* Monthly + quarterly 

**Example:**
Looking at IT spend vs. plan is important for managing adherence to the budget throughout the year and addressing anomalies before they are no longer recoverable.

For example: Company A finds outside consultants are taking longer than expected to complete a project—consuming more budget than allocated. With this metric and a monthly review in place, the CIO and the IT Finance team are able to detect the variance and identify the cause, enabling them to address the issue before it gets out of hand. Furthermore, as this IT team looks forward in the year, they’re able to use this metric to analyze scenarios for delaying or reprioritizing other initiatives or projects to compensate and stay within the annual budget.
