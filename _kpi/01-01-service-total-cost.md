**This metric answers the questions:**
* What does each IT offering really cost to deliver?
* How is spend distributed across the app & service portfolio?

**How to use it**:
* Uncover the “long tail” of application run costs
* Align IT spending with business priorities

**Cadence:**
* Monthly + quarterly

**Example:**
The focus of this TCO metric should be on accurately reflecting the total costs of an application or service, including hidden costs such as indirect labor and soft costs (like training, travel, etc.). Correctly accumulating all of these costs enables accurate comparison to both other applications in the portfolio and to the value achieved from that spend.

Let’s look at Company B, which has grown through acquisition and has hundreds or thousands of applications in use. There’s a misperception throughout the organization that because some applications were developed years ago, they are “free.” But surprising results emerge when these apps are viewed through the lens of the TCO metric. Some of them have unallocated support costs, while others overlap with other applications performing the same function, resulting in duplicate spend. Once the business understands true costs, it’s easier to retire expensive applications.
