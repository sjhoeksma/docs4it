**This metric answers the questions**:
* How efficient are we?
* How does that compare similar peer organizations?

**How to use it**:
* Compare alternatives to decide on insource/outsource/cloud
* Demonstrate efficiency to def end budget to business peers

**Cadence**:
* Monthly + quarterly

**Example**:
Company A wants to understand how their email service costs compare with public cloud alternatives. They know they spend $200K per year for email, but how do they evaluate whether or not this is cost effective? The first step is to calculate a unit cost by dividing the total cost of email by the number of users they support. Company A has 1,000 employees, so their email average cost is $200 per user per year. 

This comparison can be used to evaluate the cost of competitive email systems, or to look at how email costs vary by division. This analysis can also extend to external benchmarks: say Company B only spends $100K per year, but they also only have 400 users. Their average cost is $250 per user per year, making Company A’s email system more cost effective.

To further evaluate spend, Company A might also subscribe to a benchmark product that demonstrates an average email unit cost of $175 per user per year. This gives the company some insight into how they compare against peers across a size, industry, and geography spectrum. While Company A may find their email average unit costs are higher than benchmarks, they may also be providing much higher service levels than a typical company.  Perhaps they provide unlimited storage and a dedicated email support service with 24/7 support and very fast response times. In this case, the industry benchmark is not the goal. Instead, they may set a goal somewhere in between, aspiring to lower their costs but still provide the higher value service.
