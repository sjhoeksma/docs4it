**This metric answers the question**:
* Are projects running efficiently and effectively?

**How to use it**:
**Improve business governance of projects
Detect and rein in or shut down runaway projects**

**Cadence**:
Monthly + quarterly 

**Tip:**
One way to gather data for this metric is to use project authorization forms, which require business units to provide specific detail for any project over a set amount of spend. These often require a projection for the full cost of a project over 5 years, not just the first year. Analysis of this data helps ensure the business truly understands the implications of the project request. Conversely, this data point also allows business units to hold IT accountable for better estimating.
