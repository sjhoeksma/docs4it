**This metric answers the questions**:
* Are we investing enough on projects that impact the business?
* Are we prioritizing the customer experience high enough?

**How to use it**:
* Ensure that IT makes a relevant impact on external customers
* Detect & curtail internal-facing “science projects”

**Cadence**:
Monthly + quarterly

**Example**:
At Company X, “make it easier for them to do business with us” is a new refrain coming from the board and executive suites. As a result, the CEO has asked the business to figure out applications and technologies that lower barriers for the organization’s customers.

IT leaders can use an analytic approach to demonstrate project focus and highlight gaps in spending. Metrics like this one highlight where technology is being applied to improve the customer experience and where it is meeting business goals. This data helps CIOs manage priorities, balance back office vs. customer-facing spend, and report results back to the business.
