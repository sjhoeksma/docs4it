**This metric answers the questions**:
* How are we prioritizing our IT budget on run vs grow initiatives?
* Are we investing enough in technology innovation?

**How to use it**:
* Shift spend from Run to Grow and Transform investments
* Align IT spend with strategic business priorities

**Cadence**:
* Monthly + quarterly

**Example:**
This metric can be eye-opening for executives because it brings the balance of IT spend to light. Imagine three distinctly different companies. At Company A, IT doesn’t play a significant strategic role. Approximately 85% of the IT budget “keeps the lights on” and only 15% is invested to help the organization grow. At Company B, 60% of the budget is spent on running the business and 40% is spent on initiatives designed to grow the business. Finally, Company C spends 50% of the IT budget on running the business, 30% on growing the business, and another 20% on transforming the business.

The % of IT Investment metric helps each company understand how they are investing against business objectives and provides a benchmark they can use to shift the focus, as needed.
