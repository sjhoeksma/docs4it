**Tip**:
Customer satisfaction scores can be collected in a variety of ways: interviews, surveys, email, and feedback buttons are all tried and tested methods for understanding customer satisfaction. According to Forrester, “…the simplest and most customer-focused way to collect this data is the short form: a feedback email sent immediately after request fulfillment or a feedback button connected through the Internet and mobile apps. Then, once or twice a year, a CSAT survey based on 15 to 30 questions can provide more detailed information.”

Analysts also suggest increasing the level of management engagement and defining respondent incentives to ensure maximum response rates.
