**CIO Reflection**:
Transparency around business demand for IT changes the way the business thinks about IT. Whether you distribute control of IT spend among business units or centralize all IT spend under the CIO, metrics that break IT spend down by business unit can be enlightening. That’s because this metric is often a starting point for productive discussions with business units about value, demand, and the alignment of IT investments. When business partners realize they are accountable for their consumption, the impact can be significant.
