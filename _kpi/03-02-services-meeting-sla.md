**This metric answers the question**:
* Are we delivering the agreed-to service performance & quality?

**How to use it**:
* Meet service obligations to the business
* Identify & correct quality slippage before it gets out of hand

**Cadence**:
Monthly + quarterly

**Tip:**  
When SLAs were developed 20 years ago, they tended to prove that IT wasn’t as good as it said it was. Today, you can use SLAs to talk about the value customers can get from you in exchange for the cost they’re incurring. Then the SLA, paired with cost transparency, becomes part of a value conversation.

As IT leaders embrace transparency to better align services with demand, SLAs help both IT and the business understand current capabilities, clarify business requirements, and drive continuous improvement. When a customer provides IT with requirements, and IT establishes how it will meet those requirements with services, a key metric like this one keeps everyone on track—strengthening alignment and improving satisfaction with IT.
