title:  Business continuity
category: Operations principle
description: Corporate activities must be maintained, despite system interruptions.
rationale: 
 - As system operations become more inherent, we become more dependent of them. Therefore, we must consider the reliability of such systems throughout their entire conception and application. Business areas throughout the entire company must be able to continue conducting their normal activities, regardless of external events. Hardware failures, natural disasters, and lack of data integrity must not interrupt business activities. Business activities must be able to employ alternative mechanisms to convey information.
implications:
 - Dependence on shared applications implies that business interruption risks must be expected and managed in advance. Management includes, but is not limited to, periodic revisions, vulnerability and exposure tests, or designing mission-critical services to ensure continuity through redundancies or alternative resources.
 - Recoverability, redundancy, and maintenance must be approached at inception.
 - Applications must be assessed regarding criticality and impact on the company's mission to determine which continuity level is required and which corresponding recovery plan must be implemented.
