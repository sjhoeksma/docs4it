title: Common terminology and data definitions
category: Information principle
description: Data is defined coherently throughout the company, and definitions are comprehensible and accessible by all users.
rationale: 
 - The data employed in the development of applications must have a common definition so that the data can be shared. A common terminology facilitates communication and promotes efficient dialogs. Additionally, data and interfaces must be shared among different systems.
implications:
 - We are inclined to believe that this issue is handled appropriately, since there are individuals with "data administration" functions and stated responsibilities. However, an additional significant energy is required, in addition to resources applied in this task. This is essential to develop the information environment.
 - The company must first establish a common terminology for business activities. Such definitions must be uniformly used throughout the company.
 - Whenever a new data definition is required, efforts regarding such definition must be coordinated and reconciled with the corporate data description "glossary." The company's data administrator needs to be responsible for such coordination.
 - Ambiguities arising from multiple data definitions must be replaced by a definition that is accepted and understood by the entire company.
 - Several data normalization initiatives must be coordinated.
 - Functional data administration responsibilities must be assigned.
