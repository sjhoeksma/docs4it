title: Technological independence
category: Platform principles
description: Applications do not depend on specific technological options and, therefore, can function on different technology platforms. The IT architecture must be planned to reduce the impact of technological changes in the business.
rationale: 
 - The independence of technological applications allows them to be developed, adapted, and operated under the best cost-to-benefit ratio. Alternatively, technology (which is subject to supplier dependence and obsolescence) becomes the users' motivation, rather than their requirements.
 - This principle is based on the concept that each IT decision renders us dependent of such technology. The purpose of this principle is to ensure that the software is not dependent on specific operating system software or particular hardware.
implications:
 - This principle requires standards that support portability, which are often called open standards.
 - Application program interfaces (APIs) must be developed to integrate existing applications with operating environments and applications developed based on the enterprise architecture.
 - Middleware must be employed to disassociate applications from specific software solutions.
