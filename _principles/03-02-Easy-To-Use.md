title:  Easy-to-use applications
category: Application principles
description: Applications are easy to use. The technology is transparent to users, so it enables them to concentrate on their tasks, rather than on system operation issues.
rationale: 
 - The more that users need to understand the technology employed, the less productive they will be. The easy-to-use concept is a positive reinforcement for using applications. It encourages users to work within the integrated information environment rather than developing isolated systems to perform tasks outside of the integrated corporate environment. Most of the knowledge required to operate systems is very similar. Formatting is limited to a minimum, and system misuse risks are low.
 - Using an application must be as intuitive as driving a car from another brand.
implications:
 - All applications must have the same appearance and layout. Thus, a standard layout must be developed and usability testing criteria must be implemented.
