title: Control of technical diversity and suppliers
category: Technology principles
description: Technological diversity is controlled to minimize significant costs related to the maintenance of expertise and connectivity between several different processing environments. Supplier management must focus on the lowest number of suppliers possible to meet business needs and reduce risks.
rationale: 
 - There is a real and significant cost related to the infrastructure required to support alternative technologies for processing environments. There are other infrastructure costs to maintain the architecture of multiple interconnected processors.
 - Limiting the number of supported components and suppliers simplifies and reduces maintenance and management costs.
 - A smaller number of suppliers and software packages represent a greater ease and lower integration costs.
 - Business advantages of minimum technical diversity include
 - Standard component packaging
 - Predictable implementation impact
 - Predictable returns and validations
 - Defined tests
 - Greater flexibility to accommodate technological advances
 - A common technology throughout the entire company generates scalable economic savings for the company. Technical management and support costs are better controlled when limited resources focus exclusively on this shared technology set.
implications:
 - Policies, standards, and procedures that regulate the acquisition of technology or contracting with new suppliers must be directly bound to this principle.
 - Technology decisions are guided by the technological blueprint.
 - Procedures to increase the set of acceptable technologies to meet evolved requirements must be developed and implemented.
 - This principle does not require freezing the technological baseline. Technological advances are welcome and incorporated into the technological blueprint when they are compatible with current infrastructures, are likely to improve operating efficiency, or there is a need to increase capacity.
 - The selection of contracted suppliers must be a strategic decision, always considering other types of services that could be provided by the same supplier.
