title: Adoption of the best practices for the market
category: General principle
description: IT activities must always be aligned with the best practices for the market regarding IT governance, processing, and management.
rationale: 
 - A company always strives to adopt the best practices from its industry in its business activities. A company's IT area must follow the same strategy to enhance business activities. The IT area must deliver projects and service-level agreements (SLAs) on progressively shorter deadlines and with increasingly higher quality within an effective cost-control process.
implications:
 - Best practices for IT disciplines must be identified and studied to implement them properly. These areas, among others, must follow best practices
 - IT processes must be certifiable and use established metrics.
 - There must be a global risk perspective, focused on failure 0, and records of incidents and events.
 - The management of IT costs per service (revenues and expenses), must be financially comparable to those of the market.
 - IT management must be focused on indicators and a program perspective.
 - Personnel must be increasingly qualified and motivated.
 - The established IT architecture must be effectively applied in projects.
