title: Accessible information
category: Information principle
description: Information is accessible for users to perform their respective duties.
rationale: 
 - Unrestricted access to information increases the efficiency and efficacy of the decision-making process, low response turnaround time for information requests and service deliveries. Employee time is saved and the consistency of information is enhanced.
implications:
 - Accessibility involves the facility with which users obtain information.
 - The manner in which information is accessed and made available must be sufficiently flexible to satisfy a wide array of corporate users and their respective access methods.
 - Access to information does not necessarily mean granting access privileges to users to modify or disclose it. This requires an educational process and changing the company's culture.
