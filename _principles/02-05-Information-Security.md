title: Information security
category: Information principle
description: Information is protected based on integrity, availability, confidentiality, incontestability, and authenticity. Every piece of information is submitted to a security assessment based on those five factors. Security traceability includes proper inception and application of the auditing system and monitoring tools.
rationale: 
 - Open information sharing and disclosure must be balanced with the need to restrict the availability of confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information.
 - Current laws and regulations require data privacy and, simultaneously, allow free and unrestricted access. Temporary information (ongoing projects for which disclosure is still not authorized) must be protected to prevent unjustified speculation, misinterpretations, and improper use.
implications:
 - The addition of confidential and non-confidential data requires "de-confidentiality" analyses and procedures to maintain proper control. Data proprietors and functional users must determine whether the addition increases the level of confidentiality. Adequate policies and procedures to handle such revision must be implemented, including for the "de-confidentiality" process.
 - Current practices that involve the use of separate systems for different confidentiality levels must be reconsidered. Is there a software solution to separate confidential and non-confidential data? It is more expensive to manage non-confidential data in a confidential system. Currently, the only way to combine both is to place non-confidential data in the confidential system, where it remains.
 - To provide appropriate access to open information yet maintain security, the security restrictions must be identified and implemented at the data level, not at the application level.
 - Data security can be applied to restrict access to read-only or no-reading statuses. Sensitivity labels must be established for access to temporary, decisive, confidential, sensitive, or proprietary information.
 - Security must be planned in data elements from the beginning, rather than added later. Systems, data, and technologies must be protected against unauthorized access and handling. The source of information must be protected against unauthorized or accidental modifications, fraud, catastrophes, or disclosure.
 - Information must be rated regarding the five factors established in this principle. It is essential to quantify the financial impact of violating each one for more critical information.
