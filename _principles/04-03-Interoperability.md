title: Interoperability
category: Technology principles
description: Software and hardware must follow established standards that promote data, application, and technology interoperability.
rationale: 
 - Standards help ensure coherence, thus improving the ability to manage systems, raise user satisfaction, and protect current IT investments, thus maximizing return on investment and reducing costs.
 - Interoperability standards also help ensure support from several suppliers to their respective products, thus facilitating integration.
implications:
 - Interoperability and industry standards must be followed unless there is a mandatory business reason to implement a non-standard solution.
 - A process to establish standards, periodic revision, and exceptions must be established.
 - Current IT platforms must be identified and documented.
