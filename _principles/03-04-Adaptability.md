title: Adaptability and flexibility
category: Application principles
description: IT systems are conceived to generate change, and they reflect alterations in laws, social needs, or other types of changes. Adaptability and flexibility reduce the complexity and promote integration, which improves the company's business activities. Excessive customization increases costs and reduces the ability to adapt.
rationale: 
 - Adhering to this principle has several benefits:
 - Allows the infrastructure to support changes that frequently occur in business processes within the company.
 - Renders the infrastructure more adaptable to IT changes and IT market strengths.
 - Allows the improvement of business processes.
 - Promotes a simpler and faster system integration process, with less revision processes
 - Allows systems to evolve to meet business needs and changes
 - Complex systems with several data and transactional functions are difficult to manage and make changes extremely risky.
 - The goal is to avoid dependency failures that can result from highly coupled applications.
implications:
 - Initially, the systems might require more time to conceive and greater systemic consideration as operations go beyond the systems' traditional boundaries.
 - Initial costs might be higher, but the integration process will be less expensive.
 - Systems will last longer; therefore, the return will be greater.
 - A system can be suboptimal in the short-term but present optimization gains in the long term.
 - Adaptability and flexibility performance metrics must be established.
 - The development of applications based on components must be promoted and facilitated.
 - A minimum number of suppliers, products, and configurations must be maintained to allow maximum flexibility when implementing changes.
 - Excessively complex configurations of components, undue customized tuning, and hardware and software customization based on transient, local, or other conditions must all be avoided.
 - The discipline of configuration must be maintained, sacrificing performance and functionality in some cases.
 - Resource restrictions must be considered.
