title: Changes based on requirements
category: Operations principles
description: Changes in applications and technologies are implemented only to meet business needs. 
rationale: 
 - This principle promotes an atmosphere where the information environment changes to reflect business needs, rather than changing the business to reflect IT changes. This ensures that the business operation is the basis for any change proposal.
 - Involuntary effects on businesses resulting from IT changes are mitigated.
 - Technology changes can generate opportunities to improve the business process and, subsequently, alter business needs.
implications:
 - Changes in implementation follow a complete assessment of proposed changes, based on the enterprise architecture.
 - A system development or technical improvement is not implemented unless there is a documented business need.
 - A business need must be considered, but it must also be aligned with other enterprise architecture principles. There must be a balance between business needs and IT operations.
