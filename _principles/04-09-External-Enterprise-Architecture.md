title: Enterprise architecture also applies to external applications
category: Platform principles
description: As new outsourcing contracts and agreements are entered into, they must reflect and incorporate the enterprise architecture principles. This is one of the ways to keep enterprise architecture in line with the business. Outsourced activities must not be exceptions to the enterprise architecture simply because they are outsourced.
rationale: 
 - To be successful, enterprise architecture must be integrated with all stages of IT projects: inception, planning, and acquisition.
implications:
 - Procurement areas must receive enterprise architecture training
 - This requires partnerships and efficient communication between business, acquisitions, contract management, and IT areas to get the benefits offered by the enterprise architecture.
 - IT acquisitions must include requirements based on the enterprise architecture.
 - The investment vision for the business must include IT requirements.
