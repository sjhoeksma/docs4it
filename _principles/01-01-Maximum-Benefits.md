title: Maximum benefits at the lowest costs and risks
category: Business principle
description: Strategic decisions for solutions must always strive to maximize benefits generated for the business at the lowest long-term risks and costs.
rationale: 
 - Decisions must not be made based solely on reaching lower solution costs. Every strategic decision must be assessed based on cost, risk, and benefit perspectives. Lower costs often represent greater risks and, perhaps, fewer benefits.
implications:
 - A solution must be selected based on a qualitative or quantitative cost, risk, and benefit assessment
 - Most times, quantitative assessments are simpler based on cost perspective but more complex for risks and even more intricate for benefits. The quantitative assessment must always be conducted whenever possible and sufficient.
 - A qualitative assessment of one or two perspectives is sufficient when a quantitative assessment of other perspectives (for example, cost) is properly conducted and already leads to a decision.
 - Operating risks must be quantified whenever possible.
 - IT infrastructure must also be optimized based on business requirements and technological capacity to generate lower costs and risks, thus benefiting the focus of the company.
