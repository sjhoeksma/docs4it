Principle 15. Convergence with the enterprise architecture
Description
The convergence with the enterprise architecture is promoted in the right time, and in line with the company's investment strategy.
The convergence with the enterprise architecture takes place as new applications are built, new technologies are implemented, and older systems are updated or decommissioned. Exceptions to the enterprise architecture might be supported for specific cases if there is a consensus that the benefits of using a solution from a specific technology exceed those arising from the adoption of the enterprise architecture.
Rationale
Convergence offers several advantages:
It allows the enterprise architecture to evolve and accommodate changes in business and technologies.
It avoids conversions of obsolete systems, which are extremely expensive.
Over time, it preserves the investment while promoting the benefits of the enterprise architecture.
Implications
Delayed convergence could reduce the benefits of the enterprise architecture.
Convergence requires a realistic and tangible approach to migration to the enterprise architecture.
It requires an explicit transition strategy for current systems after the target technology is identified.
Allows decommissioning a system sooner when that is appropriate.
Convergence does not allow waiting indefinitely. It requires a business case for exceptions, an exception process, and an exit strategy. It must establish temporary or permanent exceptions, as well as exit strategies for temporary exceptions.
Convergence requires sponsorship to replace obsolete technologies.
