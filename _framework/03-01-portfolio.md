{{ page.introduction }}
Portfolio Management is an important mechanism for determining eligibility
for workloads and for prioritizing services delivery. It serves
as a focal point for life cycle management of both applications and services.
Teams will need to develop new skills and processes to evaluate services
and a workloads eligibility.

Development is coordinated by the Development Management Office (DMO), which also sets and promotes development practices for company-wide control, visibility and consistency. DMO has the mandate to classify and prioritize development initiatives to be approved or rejected by Development Portfolio Steering. DMO has control over resources, dependencies and the performance of major development initiatives, while providing the required support and consultation to maximize business benefits creation and minimize risks.

Many organizations have a Project Management Office (PMO) that handles all the same tasks as the DMO, but just for projects. As more and more development takes place beyond projects, it is recommended to have a full-scope DMO to replace the PMO.

Projects vary greatly in terms of targets, duration, budget, staffing and difficulty. Consequently, not all development initiatives require a project and they can be classified as a change. In all development, excluding a straightforward change, the following topics need to be managed:

Business Case validity
Goals, scope and constraints
Timetables and costs
Tasks and deliverables
Workloads and needed resources (internal and/or external)
Compliance with Enterprise Architecture
Quality and risks
