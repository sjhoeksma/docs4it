IT architects and designers use a variety of architectural dimensions and models
to understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their
relationships. Organizations use the capabilities of the Platform Perspective to
describe the structure and design of all types of cloud architectures.
With information derived using this Perspective, you can describe the

includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud,
and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.
