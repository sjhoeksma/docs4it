{{ page.introduction }}
A common budgeting change involves moving from capital asset expenditures
and maintenance to consumption-based pricing. The move requires new skills
to capture information and new processes to allocate cloud asset costs that
accommodate consumption-based pricing models. You want to ensure that your
organization maximizes the value of its cloud investments. Charge-back models
are another common change with cloud adoption. Cloud services provide
options to create very granular charge-back models. You will be able to track
consumption with new details, which creates new opportunities to associate
costs with results.
