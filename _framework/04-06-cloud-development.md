New skills and processes for Continuous Integration and Continuous
Deployment (CI/CD) are a critical part of designing applications that take
advantage of cloud services and the agility promised by cloud computing.

Development is a coordinated set of actions to capture requirements based on business needs, to implement a feasible solution, and to deploy it to users. All these actions need to be done according to agreed development practices within the given scope of time, resources and value creation expectations. Development can be a continuous flow of changes or, in larger and more complex cases, project-based.
