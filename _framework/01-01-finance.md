introduction: Addresses the organisation capability to plan, allocate, and manage the budget for IT expenses given changes introduced with a services consumption model.

{{ page.introduction }}
A common budgeting change involves moving from capital asset expenditures
and maintenance to consumption-based pricing. The move requires new skills
to capture information and new processes to allocate cloud asset costs that
accommodate consumption-based pricing models. You want to ensure that your
organization maximizes the value of its cloud investments. Charge-back models
are another common change with cloud adoption. Cloud services provide
options to create very granular charge-back models. You will be able to track
consumption with new details, which creates new opportunities to associate
costs with results.

## Cost for Services

It can be difficult to calculate the cost of a service. In the picture shows a model to help you make this calculation. 
* Direct costs are clearly attributable to a single service
* Absorbed Indirect costs are those incurred on behalf of all or a number of services. These have to be apportioned to all or the number of services in a fair manner.
* Un-absorbed Indirect costs cannot be apportioned to a set of services and have to be recovered from all services in as fair away as is possible

## Cost Elements for Agile Teams
When using cloud you probably will introduce agile teams. The advantage of Agile teams is that there cost are predictable. ![Agile Cost Elements](/assets/framework/agilecostelements.png){: .max-rem40}

## Cost Control for Agile Teams
As stated the one of the advantages of Agile Teams is cost control, the burn rate is stable so if you get a stable income the finacial out come is predicatable. Let's take a look at an example using a battery cost model.

![Battery Cost Model](/assets/framework/batterycostmodel.png){: .max-hrem30}{: .max-rem20}

An agile team consist of 6 team members. The members have all the same rate (€70 incl. 8% innovation + overhead) as a result the average month cost are €75.000.
The total year cost will be €900.000 and therefore the team can spend €72.000 on innovation (4 weeks). 

If we take the assumption that the agile team in average will spend 32% of there time on operations in form of SLE/SLA (€288.000)  their target is to spend 60% on Advisory and Delivery (€540.000)

Using a battery model we can evaluate if the agile team will break even at the end of FYI.

Compute resources are always charged directly to the functions and therefor don't need to be part of the battery model
