With Cloud, you have services and independent software vendor (ISV)
solutions available to help you automate incident response and recovery, and to
mitigate portions of disaster recovery. As you implement your cloud security, it
is possible to shift the primary focus of the security team from response to
performing forensics and root cause analysis.
