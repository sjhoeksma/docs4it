## THE SKILLS OF THE DATA SCIENTIST

### Programming

Data scientists deal with datasets that are far too large and complicated to open in Excel. Rather than limit themselves to tabs and sheets, data scientists use programming to work with whole databases that they manipulate to glean usable information.

### Data Analysis
There are two general ways to consider data analysis. You can either start with a problem and analyze data in an attempt to find the solution to that problem, or you can start with massive amounts of data and analyze it in search of specific trends that point to opportunities within the marketplace from which the dataset was derived. After either method, the data has to be cleaned up, formatted, and presented to teams of people in a way that can be understood and used by people who are not data scientists.

### Predictive Modeling

Predictive modeling is what separates the data scientist from the data analyst. Data scientists are tasked with predicting the future using data from the past. For example, BuzzFeed wants to predict whether an article will go viral, so it gets a data scientist to look at the available data: past articles that have gone viral, most-searched words, etc. To mine that massive amount of data, the data scientist will use machine learning methods such as regressions, support vector machines, or decision trees to determine what kind of articles BuzzFeed should be writing and what keywords it should include to increase the probability of an article going viral.

## THE TOOLS OF THE DATA SCIENTIST

### Python & R

Python is a more practical approach to data science and a good language for beginners to learn. Python scripts are generally faster than working in R, and allow data scientists to connect data pipelines with web apps and frameworks used in modern production. R is more traditional and offers many niche models, but Python is better supported and has the benefit of scale.

Together, Python and R allow data scientists to build and automate much of their analysis. Python and R have functions and libraries that can run mathematical calculations on data to build descriptive and predictive models. Data scientists use Python and R to run, share, and distribute their work among colleagues and companies. For example, if a company is trying to predict the sales cycle of a product, it can use Python + data science methods to sort and filter incoming data, build an algorithmic model, and generate actionable insights.

### SQL

SQL stands for “Structured Query Language,” and it’s the tool of choice for data analysis. Data scientists use SQL to organize their databases and pull specific subsets of data for analysis and modeling. While there are many types of databases — including some that don’t use SQL — SQL databases are by far the most common. SQL syntax is also the foundation for many of the tools used to work with “big data” systems like Hadoop.

Together, SQL, R, and Python give data scientists the power to acquire, sort, and mine data in order to build powerful predictive models.
