As the product owner, you wear a lot of hats: product expert, backlog groomer, voice of the customer and more. You’re embedded in the agile team—interfacing between developers and customers, writing user stories, collaborating with testers on acceptance criteria and translating the product roadmap into a manageable product backlog. And you do all of this while putting the customer first, ensuring that customer value is at the heart of all decisions made by your agile team.

What Makes a Successful Product Owner
* Enjoy working with developers and be physically located near your dev team.
* Have a talent for engaging with users to discuss existing features.
* Be comfortable with the unpredictability that comes with software development—understanding that roadblocks tend to occur at the least convenient times.
* Be decisive and be able to make decisions based on limited data.
