The **ScrumMaster** is at the heart of the agile team—focused on the team itself and not the project. You continuously ensure your team stays on task and aligned with proper scrum workflows while providing guidance in best practices and motivation if things do not go as planned. And if your team experiences any roadblocks along the way, you—in all of your agile wisdom—help remove what’s in your team’s way to success.

Facilitators make **Design Thinking** work more productive. A team that has a well-trained design facilitator can come to a drastically different outcome. This individual understands what it takes to have a good ideation session, and comes prepared to the meeting to make it happen. She ups the energy level in the room with a “stoke”, a short exercise that gets the team members’ brains and bodies moving. She lays out the ground rules for the session and makes sure everyone has the proper tools. She guides the participants through the exercise, moving things along when idea creation slows down and picking out moments to slow down when she sees certain team members’ processing an idea. She also knows when to call the session to a close and to move onto the next phase in the design thinking process
