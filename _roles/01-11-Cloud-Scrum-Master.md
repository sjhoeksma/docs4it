The ScrumMaster is at the heart of the agile team—focused on the team itself and not the project. You continuously ensure your team stays on task and aligned with proper scrum workflows while providing guidance in best practices and motivation if things do not go as planned. And if your team experiences any roadblocks along the way, you—in all of your agile wisdom—help remove what’s in your team’s way to success.
