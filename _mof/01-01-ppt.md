{{ page.introduction }} When using IT Service Management frameworks for organizational improvement, each of these three areas should be addressed.
An important consequence of applying this paradigm is the separation of functions from processes. 
A process is a structured set of activities designed to accomplish a defined objective in a measurable and repeatable manner, transforming inputs into outputs. Processes result in a goal-oriented change, and utilize feedback for self-enhancing and self-corrective actions. 
MOF defines a process as interrelated tasks that, taken together, produce a defined, desired result. A function is an organizational capability, a combination of people, processes (activities), and technology, specialized in fulfilling a specific type of work, and responsible for specific end results. Functions use processes.
MOF doesnâ€™t offer a definition for function alone; rather, it defines the term service management function (SMF) as a core part of MOF that provides operational guidance for Microsoft technologies employed in computing environments for information technology applications. SMFs help organizations to achieve mission-critical system reliability, availability, supportability, and manageability of IT solutions.
