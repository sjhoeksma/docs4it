## What is ITIL? 
ITIL offers a broad approach to the delivery of quality IT services. ITIL was initially developed in the 1980s and 1990s by CCTA (Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, now the Office of Government Commerce, OGC), under contract to the UK Government. Since then, ITIL has provided not only a best practice based framework, but also an approach and philosophy shared by the people who work with it in practice.

### ITTL - The Service Lifecycle 
ITIL Version 3 (2007) approaches service management from the lifecycle of a service. The Service Lifecycle is an organization model providing insight into the way service management is structured, the way the various lifecycle components are linked to each other and to the entire lifecycle system. 
The Service Lifecycle consists of five components. Each volume of the ITIL V3 core books describes one of these components:
* Service Strategy
* Service Design
* Service Transition
* Service Operation
* Continual Service Improvement

Service Strategy is the axis of the Service Lifecycle that defines all other phases; it is the phase of policymaking and objectives. The phases Service Design, Service Transition, and Service Operation implement this strategy, their continual theme is adjustment and change. The Continual Service Improvement phase stands for learning and improving, and embraces all cycle phases. This phase initiates improvement programs and projects, and prioritizes them based on the strategic objectives of the organization. Each phase is run by a system of processes, activities and functions that describe how things should be done. The subsystems of the five phases are interrelated and most processes have overlap into another phase. 


##  What is MOF? 
First released in 1999, Microsoft Operations Framework (MOF) is Microsoft’s structured approach to helping its customers achieve operational excellence across the entire IT service lifecycle. MOF was originally created to give IT professionals the knowledge and processes required to align their work in managing Microsoft platforms cost-effectively and to achieve high reliability and security. The new version, MOF 4.0, was built to respond to the new challenges for IT: demonstrating IT's business value, responding to regulatory requirements and improving organizational capability. It also integrates best practices from Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF). 

### MOF - IT Service Lifecycle 
The IT service lifecycle describes the life of an IT service, from planning and optimizing the IT service and aligning it with the business strategy, through the design and delivery of the IT service in conformance with customer requirements, to its ongoing operation and support, delivering it to the user community. Underlying all of this is a foundation of IT governance, risk management, compliance, team organization, and change management.
The IT service lifecycle of MOF is composed of three ongoing phases and one foundational layer that operates throughout all of the other phases:
* Plan phase: plan and optimize an IT service strategy in order to support business goals and objectives.
* Deliver phase: ensure that IT services are developed effectively, deployed successfully, and ready for Operations.
* Operate phase: ensure that IT services are operated, maintained, and supported in a way that meets business needs and expectations.
* Manage layer: the foundation of the IT service lifecycle. This layer is concerned with IT governance, risk, compliance, roles and responsibilities, change management, and configuration. Processes in this layer apply to all phases of the lifecycle.

## Main Components
Each phase of the IT service lifecycle contains Service Management Functions (SMFs) that define and structure the processes, people, and activities required to align IT services to the requirements of the business. The SMFs are grouped together in phases that mirror the IT service lifecycle. Each SMF is anchored within a lifecycle phase and contains a unique set of goals and outcomes supporting the objectives of that phase.
Each SMF has three to six key processes. Each SMF process has one to six key activities.
For each phase in the lifecycle, Management Reviews (MRs) serve to bring together information and people to determine the status of IT services and to establish readiness to move forward in the lifecycle. MRs are internal controls that provide management validation checks, ensuring that goals are being achieved in an appropriate fashion, and that business value is considered throughout the IT service lifecycle.
