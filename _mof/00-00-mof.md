introduction: IT organizations are continuously challenged to deliver better IT services at lower cost in a turbulent environment. Several management frameworks have been developed to cope with this challenge, one of the best known being the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL).

Microsoft® Operations Framework (MOF) is Microsoft’s structured approach to the same goal as ITTL.

The analysis follows a number of management paradigms that have proven to be essential to IT Service Management: 
1. [Process, People, and Technology (PPT)](01-01-ppt)
1. [Strategy, Tactics and Operations (STO) ](01-02-sto)
1. [Separation of Duties (SoD)](01-03-sod)
1. [The Strategic Alignment Model Enhanced (SAME)](01-04-same)
1. [Deming’s Plan-Do-Check-Act Management Cycle](01-05-deming)

At the highest level, both frameworks follow a lifecycle approach, but these lifecycles are somewhat different. ITIL uses five elements for its lifecycle: Strategy, Design, Transition, Operation, and Continual Improvement, which brings it close to the PDCA model. MOF’s lifecycle core consists of only three phases: Plan, Deliver, and Operate, with one underlying layer (Manage) covering the components that apply to all lifecycle phases. 

Both ITIL and MOF use processes and functions as building blocks, although the emphasis differs significantly. ITIL labels most of its components as processes and activities (ITIL has 26 Processes and four functions), while MOF is almost entirely based on Service Management Functions (SMFs), each SMF having a set of key processes, and each process having a set of key activities. This rigid structure supports consistency throughout the framework. 

In both frameworks, control of the lifecycle progress runs through a number of transition milestones. These milestones have been made very explicit in MOF’s Management Reviews (MRs).
Both frameworks apply the PDCA improvement approach throughout the lifecycle. MOF, like ITIL, offers best-practice guidance that can be followed in full but also in part, for addressing a subset of local problems. The “ITSM language” is quite consistent between both frameworks, with only minor differences. But there also are significant differences between the two frameworks. 

A remarkable difference is the way customer calls are handled: ITIL separates incident calls from operational service requests and change requests, and MOF combines several customer request types in a single Customer Service SMF.
ITIL and MOF also use very different role sets and role titles. This is largely due to the difference in starting points: ITIL works from the best practices documented in each phase, where MOF starts from a structured organization perspective.
An area of significant difference can be found in the approach the two frameworks take to technology. 
A key element of ITIL is that it is both vendor- and solution-agnostic—meaning, the practices encouraged by ITIL can be applied across the board regardless of the underlying technology. The result is that ITIL focuses on the management structure that makes IT successful, rather than on the technology. 

Distinctly different, Microsoft has created MOF to provide a common management framework for its platform products, although MOF can easily be used for other platforms. 

Another difference is that ITIL is available in five core books that are sold through various channels, while MOF is available on the internet for free, offering practical guidance in various formats. As a consequence, ITIL copyright is highly protected, where Microsoft made MOF content available under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which makes it freely available for commercial reuse.

Finally, ITIL offers a complex certification scheme for professionals, where Microsoft currently limits its certification for MOF to just one MOF Foundation examination. At the time of this writing, plans for further certifications are under consideration, but no final decisions have been made.

The ITIL certification scheme is much more extensive, and, in effect, offers a qualification structure that can offer a potential career path for IT professionals.

Both frameworks show plenty of similarities and can be used interchangeably in practice. Both also have some specific features that may be of good use in a specific case. Main focus of ITIL is on the “what,” where MOF concentrates on the “what” as well as the “how.”
