{{ page.introduction }}
 Applying the widely accepted control mechanism of Separation of Duties (SoD), also known as Separation of Control (SoC), we find a domain where information system functionality is specified (Information Management), and another domain where these specifications are realized (Technology Management). The output realized by the Technology Management domain is the operational IT service used by the customer in the Business domain.
