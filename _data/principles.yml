- title: IT and business alignment
  category: General principles
  description: Information management decisions are always made under the business alignment perspective in order to generate maximum benefits for the company as a whole.
  rationale: 
   - This principle means "service above all." A better alignment between IT and the business must generate a competitive edge for the financial institution.
   - Decisions based on the corporate perspective have greater long-term value than decisions based on a certain perspective of a group with a specific interest. An optimal ROI requires information management decisions to be aligned with the company's priorities and positioning. No single area must affect the benefit of the company. This principle, however, must not prevent anyone from performing tasks and activities.
  implications:
    - Aligning IT with the business and promoting optimal corporate benefits requires changes in how information is planned and managed. Technology alone is not enough to promote such changes.
    - IT must direct its processes towards the front office.
    - IT cost management must focus on IT services directed toward establishing a competitive edge.
    - IT management must add responsiveness and availability indicators.
    - IT architecture must implement a complete IT vision that is focused on business.
    - Some areas might need to waive their specific preferences to benefit the company as a whole.
    - Application development priorities must be established by and for the entire company.
    - Application components must be shared among all areas of the financial institution.
    - Information management initiatives must be conducted based on a corporate plan. Individual areas must follow information management initiatives in accordance with corporate plans and priorities. Planning is modified whenever necessary.
    - As new needs arise, priorities must be adjusted proportionally. A corporate representation committee must make such decisions.
